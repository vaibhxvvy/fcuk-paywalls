[**Open Source Tools. Zero Bullsh*t.**

## Philosophy

| We believe                    | We reject                        |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Tools should work immediately | Forced registration walls        |
| Your data belongs to you      | Data harvesting and tracking     |
| Open source is the default    | Proprietary black boxes          |
| Simple is better              | Bloat and unnecessary complexity |
| The wall is the problem       | The wall is the solution         |

## Featured

> Why are some tools featured?

It's simple. We're at 200+ tools, and a lot of them are similar. To break the homogeneity, I flag the unique ones to the top. This is biased since "what is uniqueness?" and I simply define that as a tool that is different from the other ones. Whether it's outstanding quality, or simply a very unique idea.
